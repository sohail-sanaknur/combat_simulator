This is a combat simulator which pits one army against another. The army combat is simulated through well defined rules, constraints and error handling.

At the start of the game, each commander is given a starting total of $10. Units are purchased and stored in their army. The commanders may spend as much or as little of their money as they desire. After the armies are assembled, the units are then made to ﬁght each other in the order they were purchased in. Each unit in the standard game costs $1.

There are three types of units available: • Archer • Soldier • Knight

Archer beats soldier but loses to knight. Soldier beats Knight but loses to Archer and Knight beats Archer but loses to Soldier.

In the extended game, there are three additional units available: • Medic • Siege Equipment • Wizards
